# AWS DevOps CI/CD Project 🚀

This project demonstrates a complete end-to-end CI/CD pipeline using DevOps best practices. It is designed and implemented from scratch using tools and technologies like:

- **Terraform** for Infrastructure as Code  
- **AWS EC2, S3, ECR, VPC, ALB, ASG, CloudWatch**  
- **Docker** for containerization  
- **Jenkins** for CI/CD automation  
- **Ansible** for configuration management  
- **GitHub** for version control  
- **Monitoring** using Prometheus and Grafana (simulated)  
- **Alerting** via AWS CloudWatch

## 🎯 Objective

Create a highly available, auto-scalable and secure deployment pipeline using AWS + DevOps tools, simulating a production environment.

---

## 🚀 Pipeline Flow

1. **Code pushed to GitHub**
2. **Jenkins** triggers the build
3. Docker image is built and pushed to **ECR**
4. **Ansible** deploys to EC2 servers (via ALB)
5. Monitoring and alerts enabled via **CloudWatch**

---

## 📦 Future Enhancements

- Add GitHub Actions  
- Integrate Prometheus for deep metrics  
- Use S3 + CloudFront for static hosting

> 🛠️ Built with passion, by me — hands-on, real-life setup.
